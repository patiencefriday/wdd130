        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, I am Patience Friday" width="200">
        <p>Hello, my name is Patience Friday and I am from Akwa ibom state, Nigeria. I am studying web development in
            BYU Pathway Worldwide. This is a great opportunity and I am excited to be in this class. I hope to acquire
            as much knowledge as I can, so I can be successful in the industry.
            I am also looking forward to learning new skills that will strengthen my creativity, problem-solving
            and confidence as a developer. Web development has always interested me because it allows you to bring ideas
            to
            life, and I am eager to understand how real websites are built and how to improve them.
            Being part of this program motivates me to stay focused, consistent, and open to learning from both my
            instructors and classmates. I believe the experiences I gain here will prepare me for future opportunities
            in the tech
            world. My goal is to grow into a skilled developer who can create meaningful and impactful projects.
            I am grateful for this chance to learn and improve, and I'm excited to see my progress throughout the
            course.</p>
